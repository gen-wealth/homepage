  "ourService.title": "Our Service",
  "ourService.p1": "Frozen assets in the crypto world due to being locked in wallets forever is a big problem. We offer a {secure} and {trustless} solution that allows you to pass on your assets to your loved ones.",

  "howItWorks.title": "How it Works",
  "howItWorks.p1": "Our DApp allows you to create {vaults}. A vault is a smart contract address, it's just like a wallet where you have self custody and full control over its contents. In addition, you can define rules about how you want the assets to be distributed. When you create a vault, you'll get a unique address, you'll also get a {vaultKey}, and you set a {deadline}. The deadline can be postponed from time to time, we call this {proofOfLife}. As the vault owner, you can withdraw from the vault at any time regardless of the deadline. You can share the vault access by minting more vault key tokens and sending them to your other wallets.",
  "howItWorks.p2": "Within your vault, you can create subdivisions called {pockets} where you allocate your inheritance assets across them. Next, you can mint the associated {pocketKeys} to be sent to the beneficiaries. It is these pocket key tokens that allow them to claim their share of the assets from the designated pockets only after the vault's deadline has completely elapsed.",
  "howItWorks.p3": "With this DApp, you can prevent your crypto assets from being lost forever, locked in your wallet if you lose your seedphrase, or if something unexpected happens and you have no plans yet to leave your crypto assets behind. Now you can store your crypto assets more safely because you no longer need to entrust your seedphrase to a third party.",
  "howItWorks.p4": "GenWealth is the first inheritance protocol on {cardano}, we're planning to expand our service to other blockchains in the future. For more informations on how our smart contracts work, you can read the code documentations {here}.",
